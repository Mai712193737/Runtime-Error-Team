/*O. Two intervals
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
Given the boundaries of 2 intervals. Print the boundaries of their intersection.

Note: Boundaries mean the two ends of an interval which are the starting number and the ending number.

Input
Only one line contains two intervals [l1,r1]
 ,[l2,r2]
 where (1≤l1,l2,r1,r2≤109)
 , (l1≤r1,l2≤r2)
.

It's guaranteed that l1≤r1
 and l2≤r2
.

Output
If there is an intersection between these 2 intervals print its boundaries , otherwise print -1.
